Continue to the Great Sphinx, the giant statue of a reclining mythical beast with a lion’s body and the face of the Pharaoh Khafre. Go to the Valley Temple opposite, attributed to the Pharaoh Khafre, and marvel at the feat of ancient engineering. Next, take a 30-minute break for lunch at a local restaurant. Then, drive into central Cairo to discover the artifacts at the Egyptian Museum in Tahrir Square with fast-track entry.

Learn about the mummification art of Ancient Egypt before your return transfer to Hurghada. After visiting all the attractions, enjoy a shopping stop before beginning the journey back to Hurghada.",
